# Vanishing and Exploding Gradients

In the context of neural networks, a gradient is **a vector of partial derivatives of a loss function with respect to the network's weights**. It represents how much the loss function will change if a weight is adjusted by a small amount. The gradient is used to update the weights during the training process to minimize the loss function.

## Problems

### Vanishing Gradients

The vanishing gradient problem occurs when the gradients become exceedingly small during backpropagation. This leads to very small updates to the weights, especially in the early layers of the network, making it difficult for the network to learn effectively.

### Exploding Gradients

The exploding gradient problem occurs when the gradients become excessively large during backpropagation. This causes the weights to update with very large values, leading to instability and divergence during training.

## Possible Causes

### Activation Functions

Activation functions like Sigmoid and Tanh squash their input into a small range (0 to 1 for Sigmoid and -1 to 1 for Tanh). When the input values are in the saturated regions of these functions (far from 0), the derivatives become very small, approaching 0, resulting in tiny gradients during backpropagation. Conversely, certain activation functions can also amplify gradients, contributing to the exploding gradient problem.

### Deep Networks

In deep networks, the multiplication of many small gradients (for each layer) can lead to an exponentially small gradient, causing vanishing gradients. Conversely, the multiplication of many large gradients can lead to an exponentially large gradient, causing exploding gradients.

### Initialization

Poor weight initialization can lead to both vanishing and exploding gradients. If weights are initialized with very small values, the gradients propagated backward through the network will also be small, compounding the vanishing gradient problem. Conversely, initializing weights with very large values can lead to large gradients during backpropagation, causing the exploding gradient problem.

## Solutions

### Use of ReLU Activation Function

The ReLU activation function and its variants (e.g., Leaky ReLU) do not suffer from the vanishing gradient problem as much because they do not saturate for positive input values. ReLU outputs the input directly if it is positive, which helps in maintaining a larger gradient. Additionally, ReLU variants can help prevent the exploding gradient problem by allowing a small, non-zero gradient for negative input values (as in Leaky ReLU), which can reduce the risk of excessively large gradients during backpropagation.

### Batch Normalization

Batch normalization normalizes the outputs of a previous layer to have a mean close to 0 and a variance close to 1. This helps in stabilizing and accelerating the training process, preventing the gradients from becoming too small or too large. [batch normalization](./batch_normalization.md)

### Proper Weight Initialization

Initializing weights using methods like He initialization (for ReLU) or Xavier initialization (for Sigmoid and Tanh) can help in mitigating both vanishing and exploding gradient problems. [initialization](./initialization.md)

### Gradient Clipping

Gradient clipping involves setting a threshold value to clip gradients during backpropagation, preventing them from growing too large and causing the exploding gradient problem.
